## Transfer Instructions

To continue development in a new conversation:

1. **Start a new conversation** with the AI assistant
2. **Copy this project summary** and paste it as context
3. **Reference specific files** when asking for modifications
4. **Use the git history** to understand previous changes
5. **Test thoroughly** after each modification

## Important Notes

- All changes have been committed to git
- The database schema is in `prisma/schema.prisma`
